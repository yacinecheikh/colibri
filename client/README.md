# Colibri cli client

## Setup

Create a python virtual environment:
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to use

To run the CLI:
```sh
.venv/bin/python client.py
```

The `client.py` script contains all the required commands to communicate with servers and other clients (generating message addresses, editing a chat room,â€¦).

By itself, the CLI client is not supposed to be used manually (the CLI is too low level). Instead, you should use a frontend to edit chat rooms in markdown for example.

The local cache is saved in the `data/` folder. Ideally, you should encrypt the entire software (in a LUKS-encrypted usb key for example) to prevent scanning or modification attempts by malicious programs.


## Remote/local storage

Messages that are stored on the server are not automatically remove when downloaded (since a failure could lose the messages).
Instead, messages have tags to identify them, and can be selected for removal locally (with the `remove-message` command) or remotely (`remove-remote-messages`)

If a message is removed locally but kept on the server, it will be downloaded again during the next update. To delete a message definitely, remove the server (remote) message before the local one.

In order to obfuscate which messages are read on the server, the client downloads every message at each update. This can cause lag on slow connections. To solve this problem, just remove the remote messages with `remove-remote-messages`. Once a message is removed from the remote server, it will never be downloaded again.

If an invite message is regenerated (by removing the local message before updating), the invite will also be regenerated if it had been removed. To avoid regenerating removed messages, remove them from the server.
